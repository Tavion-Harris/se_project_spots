# Project 3: Spots

# Spots learning to make a responsive website 
 “This is a website I’m building as a learning project to practice responsive design. The goal is to make sure it looks good and functions well on any device — whether you’re viewing it on a phone, a tablet, or a computer.”

## How did i do it ?
i used the following 
Flexbox Layouts
CSS Grid
Responsive Design with Media Queries
Semantic HTML
Reusable BEM Naming Convention


This project uses modern frontend techniques to create a clean and responsive layout. The structure is built with semantic HTML and styled using the BEM naming convention for organized, reusable CSS. Layouts are managed with Flexbox (for aligning profile elements and buttons) and CSS Grid (for the responsive card gallery). To ensure the site looks great on any device, media queries adjust the design for smaller screens, making the website fully responsive across phones, tablets, and desktops.
